Trying to set up a memory game. This is currently work in progress ! :)

To install the app you have to install nodejs and npm.

Then,

1. Install grunt :        "npm -g install grunt-cli"
   Install bower :        "npm -g install bower"

2. Install dependencies :
    Npm dependencies :
                          "npm install" in the project directory
    Bower dependencies :
                          "bower install" in the project directory

3. Developement mode
                          "grunt serve"
   
   (Production mode (not operational at this time) :
   Run : "grunt build")
